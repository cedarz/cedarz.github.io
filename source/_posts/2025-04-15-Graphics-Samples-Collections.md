网络链接，常常失效，很多大公司亦是如此。好些前两年很容易访问到的链接，忽然就失了踪迹。再者，有些资源，不收藏一下，难受。

# Nvidia Legacy OpenGL SDK samples
1. [NVIDIA GameWorks Graphics Samples](https://github.com/ahcox/NVIDIA-GameWorks-Graphics-Samples-GL4-GLES2-GLES3-Vulkan-SDK-3-16-August-2017-36-Commits)，by ahcox
> The GameWorks Graphics Samples pack is a resource for cross-platform Vulkan, OpenGL 4 (GL4) and OpenGL ES 2 and 3 (ES2 and ES3) development, targeting Android and Windows (and soon, will again support Linux x86/x64 and Linux for Tegra). It is an expansion and continuation of the longstanding OpenGL Graphics and Compute Samples, adding full support for and samples of the Vulkan 3D API.

# Vendor SDK
1. [PowerVR SDK](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK)
> C++ cross-platform 3D graphics SDK. Includes demos & helper code (resource loading etc.) to speed up development of Vulkan, OpenGL ES 2.0 & 3.x applications
> PVRVFrame is included as part of the PowerVR SDK and provides a set of desktop **emulation** libraries for OpenGL ES wrapping desktop OpenGL allowing deployment of OpenGL ES applications on desktop Windows, macOS, and Linux which can help to speed up development times and improve productivity.
2. [SnapdragonStudios/adreno-gpu-opengl-es-code-sample-framework](https://github.com/SnapdragonStudios/adreno-gpu-opengl-es-code-sample-framework)
> This repository contains an OpenGL ES Framework for game and graphics developers to get up and running quickly for creating sample content and rapid prototyping. It is designed to be easy to build and have the basic building blocks needed for creating an Android APK with OpenGL ES functionality including an input system, as well as other helper utilities for loading resources, etc. This Framework has been extracted from and is a subset of the Adreno GPU SDK.
