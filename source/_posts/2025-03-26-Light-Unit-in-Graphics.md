> I donâ€™t know of any game engines where they attribute real-world units to lighting and material values, since those kinds of things tend to be driven more by the appearance than the physical correctness. The relative intensities of, say, a candle and a 100W light bulb are probably more important than the absolute values.[<sup>Lighting: The Rendering Equation</sup>]()
